# Roadmap
## Phase 1
Have a basic functioning runner game including these elements:
- background
- ground
- character
- obstacles in the air and on the ground

the game ends when an obstacle is not avoided

## Phase 2
- another character for switching mid-game/choosing before the game starts
- life bar
- items for life replenishment
